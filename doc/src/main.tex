\section{The Models}
\subsection{Point Mass Model}
The Point Mass Model (PMM) is a very simplified representation of a vehicle as a planar point mass.
It's dynamics are described by the differential equations
\begin{equation}
    m\ddot{x} = F_x, \quad
    m\ddot{y} = F_y,
\end{equation}
where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the vehicle in the plane,
$F_x$ and $F_y$ are the forces acting on the vehicle in the $x$- and $y$-directions respectively,
and $m$ is the mass of the vehicle.
